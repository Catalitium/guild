  <h1>Mathematics</h1>
  <p class="intro-text">
    If anything holds the crumbling edges of this universe together, it's probably math.
    Not your high school worksheets, but the raw machinery humming behind orbits, spirals,
    markets, memory. It's old—older than logic—and possibly incomplete, and yet we keep scratching
    at it like apes tapping on an alien radio, convinced we can tune into something more than just ourselves.

    <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Mathematics doesn’t answer as much as it frames the asking. It builds languages to trap truth,
      or at least give it a shape. Geometry gave us the gods of the Greeks, calculus split motion
      into infinitesimals, logic teased apart paradoxes—and Gödel laughed. This section outlines
      the key conceptual scaffolds, not as subjects, but as the whispering organs of an unfinished system.

        <h3>Arithmetic</h3>
        <p>The study of numbers and operations—ancient and foundational, used in everything from trade to cryptography.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Geometry</h3>
        <p>The shape of the world, the tension of angles, the postulates of Euclid. Still relevant, still expanding.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Algebra</h3>
        <p>From Persian al-jabr: solving for the unknown. It lets us speak symbolically, abstractly, infinitely.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Calculus</h3>
        <p>Invented in parallel by Newton and Leibniz. Measures change, motion, and growth. A blade for time itself.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Set Theory</h3>
        <p>The skeleton of modern mathematics. Cantor’s naive infinities and Zermelo-Fraenkel’s formal axioms underlie it all.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Logic</h3>
        <p>From Aristotle to Russell, logic refines reasoning. It’s the toolkit for proving what is—or isn’t—provable.</p>

    <h2>Mathematical Dictionary</h2>
    <ul class="ai-dictionary">
      <li><strong>Proof:</strong> A logical argument establishing the truth of a theorem.</li>
      <li><strong>Theorem:</strong> A statement that has been proven based on axioms and logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Function:</strong> A relation between inputs and outputs with defined rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit:</strong> The value a function approaches as input approaches some value.</li>
      <li><strong>Infinity:</strong> A concept, not a number. Bigger than anything you can count.</li>

      <li><strong>Matrix:</strong> A rectangular array of numbers—like a spreadsheet with muscle.</li>
      <li><strong>Derivative:</strong> Instantaneous rate of change—calculus' razor.</li>
      <li><strong>Integral:</strong> Area under a curve. Anti-derivative. Accumulator.</li>
